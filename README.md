# BlueMap Banner Marker
-> [**Download BlueMap here**](https://modrinth.com/mod/bluemap)

Let your players simply create markers on your BlueMap by placing down named banners! The name and color of the placed banner will be visible on the new marker.
To remove your marker simply break the banner or modify all markers in the admin panel!

## Configuration
- Customize every plugin message individual
- Customize marker designs with custom naming and custom icons
- Limit your players with blacklisted worlds or a max amount of markers

All messages can be found in the `messages.yml` file in [Adventure MiniMessages](https://webui.adventure.kyori.net/) format, settings are located at `settings.yml` and all marker icon images can be changed at `assets/marker_<color>.yml` (icons should be replaced with equivalent sized images). Changes are applied after a server restart

## Support
Simply hop on the [BlueMap Discord](https://discord.gg/zmkyJa3) and ask in #3rd-party-support :)
